## Sebastian Flavet, Gert-Ove Eng Jacobsson, Nathalie Persson, Igor Ristic

- First meeting with our new group member, Igor. He looked through the group contract (and signed it) and we explained where the project is at the moment, and what we are planning ahead. Scheduled a new pair coding session for tomorrow and Gert-Ove and Sebastian took a couple of individual issues (which Nathalie probably will have to sort out in the end).

- We (Gert-Ove and Sebastian) need to train a bit more on writing JS to really get it into our thick sku... We simply need to write more code.

- After tomorrows session we'll decide how to break down the remaining work and how to move forward in the project.
