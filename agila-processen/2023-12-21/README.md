## Sebastian Flavet, Gert-Ove Eng Jacobsson, Nathalie Persson, Igor Ristic

- We pair programmed today and introduced Igor to our code and explained what we have done. We deleted our cart array and added localstorage array. We also made sure that if we have items in localstorage the cart will not be overwritten. We changed addProducts function so that the quantity increases instead of adding the same object again. 

- We have decided to assign separate issues to all members of the group and in the last sprint we focus on CSS. 

- We had problems to add co-authors, hopefully it works now.
